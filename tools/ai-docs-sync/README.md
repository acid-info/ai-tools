# ai-docs-sync

Shared automation that keeps a repo's documentation in step with its code. On every push to a
repo's target branch it reads the code diff together with the commit messages and any linked
PRs, decides which docs are affected, rewrites (or deletes) them with one model, has a second
model check the result, runs mechanical gates, and maintains a single rolling pull request with
it.
Humans merge it.

Consumers call it as a **reusable workflow** from
[acid-info/ai-tools](../../README.md), pinned to the `ai-docs-sync/v1` tag. Upgrading the tool
or swapping a model is one edit there, not one per consumer.

> **Status: feature-complete.** Every stage is implemented and unit-tested, and the tool has run
> end to end inside GitHub Actions against a sandbox repo: opening and updating the rolling PR,
> carrying edits forward, the loop guard, dry runs and reviewer deletes.

## How it works

1. A push lands on the target branch: `develop` when the repo has one, otherwise the default
   branch, or whatever `target_branch` names.
2. The job checks out the **target branch** -- never a PR head -- for config, guideline files
   and docs, and checks out this repo for the tool.
3. The diff range runs from a cursor ref (`refs/ai-docs-sync/cursor`) to the checked-out head,
   so collapsed or queued runs never skip a commit and every commit is triaged exactly once.
4. A change narrative is built from local `git log`: each commit's title and body, plus the title
   and body of any PR those commits came from. Every model pass sees *why* the code changed, not
   just what.
5. Free exits first: a push that touches only docs (including merging the rolling PR) stops
   before any API call.
6. Triage picks the docs to update, create or delete. A writer model rewrites each one, a
   checker model reviews every rewrite, create and delete and can demand at most one correction
   pass of a rewrite, or drop a create or a delete. Every affected doc is written; there is no
   per-run cap. A new doc is created when the change adds a user- or developer-facing surface
   (an app, package, service, CLI command, config area, API, workflow or integration) that no
   doc covers and that would not fit in an existing one. Before any writer call its path must
   sit near existing editable docs: in a directory that already holds one, one new directory
   level under such a directory, or beside a sibling directory's doc of the same name
   (`packages/new/README.md` next to `packages/old/README.md`). The repo root does not count as
   a parent or sibling here, so a new top-level directory is always refused. The writer gets an
   exemplar to follow for structure and tone: the same-named doc in a sibling directory, else
   the median-sized doc in the same directory, else one in the parent. A second writer wave
   then links the new doc from an index: the `README.md` or `index.md` in its directory or the
   parent, else the shortest-path doc that already links into that directory, its parent or a
   sibling directory.
7. Mechanical gates run on every change: the path allowlist, resolution of added links against
   the post-edit tree, dash and attribution scans, size sanity, a banner for guideline-file edits
   and deletes, optional prettier.
8. The result is pushed to one rolling branch and one rolling PR per repo, updated in place.
   Edits not yet merged survive the next run. The cursor advances whatever the outcome.

Retries: every GitHub and model call has a timeout and is retried once, with backoff, on a
5xx, a 429 or Anthropic's 529. A second failure fails the run, and the cursor stays put so the
next push picks the range up again. The exceptions are the checker, whose failure leaves the
edits unchecked, and the writer: a failed call holds back only that doc, unless no writer call
succeeded and at least one failure was an outage (a 5xx, 429, 529 or network error) rather than
something about the request (a 400, a timeout).

The tool has **zero npm dependencies** and runs on Node 22's global `fetch`, with no build step.
Keep it that way.

## Adding it to a repo

Create `.github/workflows/ai-docs-sync.yml` on your **default branch**:

```yaml
# AI docs sync. The tool lives in acid-info/ai-tools (tools/ai-docs-sync); edit it there.
# Runs on every push to the target branch and maintains one rolling docs PR.
name: AI Docs Sync

on:
  push:
    # List every branch that could be the target. The shared workflow resolves the real one at
    # run time and exits for the others, so over-listing is harmless.
    branches: [develop, main, master]
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      since:
        description: 'Commit SHA to diff from (backfill / re-run). Defaults to the cursor.'
        required: false
      dry_run:
        description: 'Print the would-be PR instead of pushing it'
        type: boolean
        default: false

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  statuses: write

jobs:
  sync:
    uses: acid-info/ai-tools/.github/workflows/ai-docs-sync.yml@ai-docs-sync/v1
    with:
      # Optional. Forces the target branch. Omitted: `develop` if it exists, else the default
      # branch. Lives here rather than in .github/docs-sync.yml because the config file is read
      # from the target branch, so it cannot also choose it.
      target_branch: ''
      since: ${{ inputs.since }}
      dry_run: ${{ inputs.dry_run == true }}
    secrets:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
      OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
      # Optional. A fine-grained PAT from a shared bot account. Only needed when the default
      # branch requires status checks on every PR; see "Secrets".
      DOCS_SYNC_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DOCS_SYNC_TOKEN }}
```

`push` workflows run from the workflow file at the pushed commit, so the tool can be tested end
to end by temporarily listing a feature branch under `branches:`.

Pass the secrets explicitly. Do **not** use `secrets: inherit`: the tool has no business seeing
an `NPM_TOKEN` or a database URL.

`ai-docs-sync/v1` is a moving tag. A consumer that wants immutability pins the commit SHA instead; the
reusable workflow checks itself out at `job.workflow_sha` either way, and refuses to run if
that is empty.

### Secrets

| Secret | Required |
| --- | --- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Yes. The writer calls Claude Opus 5.5 |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Yes. Triage calls GPT-6 Luna; the checker calls GPT-6 Sol |
| `DOCS_SYNC_TOKEN` | No. Escape hatch, see below |

Triage runs at low effort. The writer and the checker run at medium.

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is supplied by Actions and is enough for the default path, with **one repo
setting**: a repo admin enables "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
(Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions). While it is off, creating a PR with
`GITHUB_TOKEN` fails with a 403 regardless of the `permissions:` block, and the tool fails fast
saying so.

A PR pushed with `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not trigger other workflows, so the rolling PR gets no CI
run. The PR is Markdown-only by construction and the tool reports its own gates as a
`docs-sync/gates` commit status.

Escape hatch, for a repo where that toggle is org-locked or the default branch requires a status
check on every PR: set `DOCS_SYNC_TOKEN` to a fine-grained PAT from a shared bot account with
`contents: write`, `pull-requests: write` and `statuses: write` on that repo only. The tool then
pushes and opens the PR as that account, which also triggers CI on the rolling branch.

## Per-repo configuration

At `.github/docs-sync.yml`, read from the **target branch**. `doc_paths` is the only required
key.

| Key | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `doc_paths` | Globs the tool may create or edit. Markdown only; anything else is refused in code. A list may be written as `- item` lines or inline as `[a, b]`. |
| `never_touch` | Subtracted from `doc_paths`. Everything under `.github/` is subtracted whether or not it is listed. |
| `extra_ignore` | Diff-side ignores, appended to the built-in list. Same semantics as ai-review. |
| `guidelines_files` | Priority list; the first that exists is loaded. `AGENTS.md` is special-cased as in ai-review. |
| `branch` | Rolling branch name. Default `docs/repo/sync`. Refused if it names the target or default branch. |
| `narrative_max_tokens` | Budget for commit and PR messages fed to the models. Default `6000`. |
| `label` | Label on the rolling PR. Default `docs-sync`. |
| `format_check` | `off` (default) or `strict`. `strict` needs `setup_command`. |
| `setup_command` | Shell run before prettier, e.g. `corepack enable && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. |

```yaml
doc_paths:
  - README.md
  - AGENTS.md
  - docs/**/*.md
  - apps/*/AGENTS.md
  - apps/*/README.md
  - apps/*/docs/**/*.md
  - packages/*/README.md

never_touch:
  - docs/superpowers/specs/**      # dated design records, not maintained docs

extra_ignore:
  - flake.lock
  - packages/types/src/payload.ts

guidelines_files:
  - AGENTS.md
  - CLAUDE.md
```

Models, effort, token budgets and severity thresholds are **owned centrally** in `DEFAULTS` in
`src/config.mjs`. Setting one in a repo config logs a warning and is ignored: a repo that could pin its
own model would put the tool back in N places.

Built-in ignores cover lockfiles, `*.min.js`, `*.map`, `dist/`, `vendor/`, `__snapshots__/` and
`*.generated.*`.

Guideline files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, anything in `guidelines_files`) are editable like any
other doc when `doc_paths` covers them. An edit or delete of one gets a banner at the top of the
PR body with the diff inline. A repo that wants them hand-maintained lists them in `never_touch`.

Deletes are always on; there is no key for them. A doc listed in `never_touch` is never deleted,
just as it is never edited.

## The rolling PR

- The rolling branch is always **the target head plus one commit** by `github-actions[bot]`
  holding every edit still open. That commit is built with git plumbing in a throwaway index,
  so the working tree never changes. It is pushed with `--force-with-lease` pinned to the
  branch state the tool inspected.
- **Carry-forward.** While a PR from the rolling branch into the target is open, its edits and
  deletes are carried into the next run. If the target has since changed one of those files,
  that edit or delete is discarded and the file goes back to triage together with the earlier
  code changes the edit documented. Triage can select it again, in which case the edit (or the
  delete) is redone on top of the target's new version. If the target deleted the file itself,
  the carried change is dropped. Either way the PR is updated, so it never keeps a conflicting
  change. A new nomination wins over a carried one: an update of a carried delete restores the
  doc, a delete of a carried edit replaces the edit. A reviewer's decision is the exception (see
  "Reviewer changes" below): the tool never undoes it. After the PR is merged or closed nothing is
  carried: merged changes are already in the target, and closing means "not now". The next
  publishing run opens a fresh PR on the same branch.
- **Deletes.** Triage nominates a delete only when a doc's whole subject is gone from the code (a
  removed app, package, feature, command, endpoint or config area), citing the diff files that
  removed it. A delete whose cited files are not in the diff is listed as a suggested deletion and
  not acted on. The checker confirms or drops every delete. Editable docs that link to a deleted
  doc get their links removed or retargeted in the same run; links from docs the tool may not
  edit are listed under the delete. Each delete links to the target's copy of the file, for
  restoring it.
- **New docs.** Creates are always on, with no config key and no cap on how many one run makes:
  `doc_paths` and `never_touch` decide where a doc may be written, and the human merge is the
  guard. A create whose path fails the placement check (see "How it works") is held back
  without a writer call. A create larger than 3x its exemplar is held back when the exemplar is
  over 400 bytes. The checker drops a create that duplicates the scope of an existing doc or
  that the diff does not justify. If a new doc is held back, so is the index update that would
  have linked it. The PR body lists new docs in their own section, above the edits, each with
  its reason, the checker's verdict and the doc that links to it, or "Not linked from any doc".
  A new doc carried from an earlier run is marked "(new)", and listed as new again when a later
  run edits it.
  To reject a new doc, delete it on the rolling branch and revert the index doc's link to it in
  the same commit: carried changes are not re-checked, so a link left behind stays broken in the
  PR. The tool does not create that doc again while the PR stays open.
- **Ownership.** The branch may hold, besides the tool's commits, merges (the PR's "Update
  branch" button) and other people's commits that only add, edit, delete or rename editable docs
  (a reviewer's suggestion, removing a doc, restoring one the tool deleted). A rename counts only
  when both paths are editable. Those changes are carried forward like the tool's own. Any other
  commit (code, a non-doc file, a path outside the allowlist), or a branch the tool never
  committed to, makes the run refuse before any paid call. Rename or delete that branch.
- **Reviewer changes.** A reviewer's decision on the branch beats the tool's, for as long as the
  PR stays open:
  - Deleting a doc the target has keeps it deleted. Triage nominations for it are dropped, and
    editable docs that link to it get their links removed or retargeted, as for the tool's own
    deletes.
  - Renaming a doc works the same way for the old path; links to it are retargeted to the new one.
  - Deleting a doc the branch added (usually one the tool created) stops the tool creating it again.
  - Restoring a doc the tool deleted stops the tool deleting it again, and the writer keeps links
    to it. The carried link fix-ups that followed that delete are discarded and go back to triage
    with the target's text.
  - If the target changes a doc a reviewer deleted, the delete is discarded and reported; delete
    it again on the branch if it is still wanted. Its carried link fix-ups go back to triage the
    same way.

  Every run rebuilds the branch, which drops the reviewers' commits, so the tool records these
  decisions in a `Reviewer decisions:` section of its own commit message and reads them back on
  the next run, rechecked against the branch. The PR body lists them under "Reviewer changes on
  this branch", each with how to undo it. To undo one, reverse it on the branch: restore the file
  you deleted, or delete again the file you restored. After the PR is merged or closed no decision
  carries, like any other change.
- The PR body lists deleted docs first, then reviewer changes, then new docs, then edited ones, per file: the triage reason, the
  checker's verdict and issues, and whether a correction pass addressed them. It also lists
  carried changes, discarded ones and whether they were redone, held-back files and the gate that
  stopped them, new links and raw HTML, suggested deletions, the commits and PRs in the range, and
  API cost. A guideline-file edit or delete is bannered at the top with its diff, capped at 8,000
  characters.
- Everything model- or narrative-derived in the body is defused: no live `@mentions`, no
  closing keywords, no raw HTML. The body is capped at 60,000 characters: over it, detail is
  shed in steps (narrative, checker notes, flags, per-file detail, then non-deleted file lines),
  and the lists of deleted paths and reviewer changes are never cut. A hidden `<!-- ai-docs-sync {...} -->` marker keeps
  up to the last 20 runs within 20,000 characters, oldest dropped first; it is informational only
  and never drives control flow.
- A `docs-sync/gates` commit status marks the branch head, because a PR pushed with
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` runs no CI.

## The cursor

`refs/ai-docs-sync/cursor` in the consumer repo points at the last target-branch commit the
tool finished with. Each run diffs `cursor..HEAD` and moves the cursor to `HEAD` whenever it
reaches a decision, whatever that decision is:

- a docs-only push (the loop guard);
- no code files left after ignores;
- a triage that finds nothing affected;
- nothing surviving the gates;
- a dry run;
- a published PR.

A run that fails leaves the cursor where it was. The ref never triggers `on: push`, and only
someone with `contents: write` can move it.

Read it or move it by hand:

```bash
git ls-remote origin refs/ai-docs-sync/cursor
git push -f origin <sha>:refs/ai-docs-sync/cursor
```

To re-process a range without touching the cursor first, dispatch the workflow with
`since=<sha>`. `since` must be an ancestor of the target head. Ranges are capped at the newest
250 commits on the target's first-parent line, so backfill a long history in slices.

## Changing a model

Edit `DEFAULTS` in `src/config.mjs`, then check **two** places in `core/models.mjs`, which every
tool shares:

1. **`PRICES`**: add the new model, or the cost line reports it as unpriced and excludes it from
   the total.
2. **`EFFORT_MODELS`** / **`REASONING_MODELS`**: model-family regexes gating Anthropic
   `output_config.effort` and OpenAI `reasoning.effort`. A model string that does not match
   silently loses the effort config rather than erroring.

Then release it (below). Every consumer picks it up on its next run.

## Releasing

`ai-docs-sync/v1` is a moving tag on `master` of acid-info/ai-tools. After a change is merged:

```bash
git checkout master && git pull && git tag -f ai-docs-sync/v1 && git push -f origin ai-docs-sync/v1
```

Only the writer-tools group may push this tag (see [Security model](../../README.md#security-model)).
Consumers that want immutability pin a commit SHA instead.

## Running it locally

```bash
npm run check && npm test
```

Run from the repo root; that is what CI runs. Every module in `src/` except `runtime.mjs` and
`stages/` is pure: no `process.env`, no network, no side effects at import time, so `test/`
imports them directly. `main.mjs` is the only file that reads the env.

To run the tool itself, `cd` into a full clone of the consumer repo checked out at its target
branch; the config is read from `.github/docs-sync.yml` there. Fetch first, so the
rolling branch's remote-tracking ref is current. In Actions the checkout does this. Then set
the env the workflow would:

```bash
git fetch origin && git checkout --detach origin/develop
```

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) REPO=owner/name TARGET_BRANCH=develop SINCE=<sha> \
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-junk OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-junk TRIAGE_ONLY=1 node /path/to/ai-tools/tools/ai-docs-sync/main.mjs
```

> **Only `TRIAGE_ONLY=1` writes nothing.** Every other run writes to the real repo as soon as
> it reaches a decision. A `DRY_RUN=1`, or even a run that exits at the loop guard, moves the
> cursor ref. A plain run force-pushes the rolling branch and opens or updates the PR. Pushes
> go to `https://github.com/<REPO>.git` with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, passed to git through the
> environment only and never through a credential helper.

| Env | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `SINCE` | Start of the diff range; must be an ancestor of the target head. Skips the cursor read. |
| `TRIAGE_ONLY=1` | Stops after triage and never writes. With junk API keys everything free runs (range, changed files, narrative, packed diff, carry-forward, manifest, guidelines) and the run dies at a 401 having spent nothing. |
| `DRY_RUN=1` | Runs the model calls and gates (paid), prints the branch, the diffs, the PR title and body, and moves the cursor. Pushes no branch, touches no PR. |
| `DEBUG=1` | Logs every model's raw output and stack traces to stderr. |
| `PUSH_BEFORE`, `PUSH_FORCED` | What the workflow passes from the push event; used only when there is no cursor ref. |
| `RUN_URL` | Linked from the PR body, the commit message and the commit status. |

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is needed even for `TRIAGE_ONLY`: the cursor ref, the default branch, the open
rolling PR and the commit-to-PR lookups that build the change narrative are all API reads.

The reusable workflow itself has no runnable form without a caller: `workflow_call` cannot be
dispatched directly. End-to-end changes have to be proved on a real push in a consumer repo.

## Security model

- The job checks out the consumer's **target branch**, never a PR head. Config, guidelines, docs
  and the tool are trusted code. The diff, commit messages and PR bodies arrive as data and are
  only ever placed in user turns.
- The tool can only write or delete `.md` files inside `doc_paths` minus `never_touch` minus a
  built-in denylist, checked on the canonicalised path (no `..`, no absolute, no symlink
  component) after every model call. A prompt-injected diff can, at worst, produce a bad doc edit
  or delete in the rolling PR, which a human reviews.
- A delete needs a cited source file that is in the code diff; narrative text alone (a commit
  message claiming a feature was removed) never deletes a doc. Guideline-file deletes are
  bannered like guideline edits. There is no per-run cap on edits or deletes: the rolling branch
  and the required human merge are the guard.
- The tool may edit its own instruction source (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `guidelines_files`)
  when `doc_paths` covers it. Such an edit is bannered at the top of the PR body with its full
  diff, and the writer loads the target branch's copy of the guidelines, never a draft from the
  same run.
- The cursor is a git ref, movable only with `contents: write`. Nothing read from a PR body
  drives control flow; the rolling PR is located by head and base, not by marker.
- The force-push target is validated (not the target or default branch, safe charset) and the
  existing branch must hold nothing but the tool's commits, merges and additions, edits,
  deletions or renames of editable docs.
- The `Reviewer decisions:` lines in the tool's commit message can be forged by anyone who can
  push to the rolling branch. That is harmless by construction: a decision can only stop the tool
  from writing, recreating or deleting a doc, never make it write one. Every path is checked
  against the allowlist, and every decision against the branch's tree, before it is used.
- No write credential is persisted in the checkout. The token and API keys are removed from the
  tool's environment at startup, so they are not passed to `setup_command`, prettier or git.
  Only the push and cursor-update child processes receive the token, via environment, and they
  run from a throwaway git dir that borrows the checkout's objects, so no hook or config written
  into `.git` runs next to the token. This does not sandbox `setup_command`: on a hosted runner
  its code runs as the same user as the tool, with passwordless sudo. A repo that does not trust
  its install scripts keeps `format_check: off`.
- `permissions:` is bounded by the consumer's workflow file. Never `secrets: inherit`.
- Nothing from the event payload is interpolated into shell text; the resolve step reads it from
  `env`.
- No network fetch of code at run time: the tool has no dependencies and `strict` formatting
  uses the consumer's own installed prettier.
- `@mentions` and issue-closing keywords in anything model- or narrative-derived are defused
  before posting.

**Whoever can push the `ai-docs-sync/v1` tag executes code with `contents: write` in every
consumer repo.** It is a separate tag from `ai-review/v1` for that reason: sharing a tag between
a reader and a writer would let whoever can push it turn a reviewer into a writer everywhere.
`core/` runs inside this tool too, so changes there need the same review. See
[Security model](../../README.md#security-model); consumers that want more pin a SHA.

## Code layout

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `main.mjs` | Entry point: reads the env, loads config, runs the stages in order. |
| `src/runtime.mjs` | Every side effect: git, the checkout on disk, GitHub, the model APIs. |
| `src/stages/` | The pipeline, one module per step: `pick-range`, `read-changes`, `carry-forward`, `read-docs`, `triage-docs`, `write-docs`, `check-docs`, `gate-docs`, `report`, `publish`. Each reads what it needs from one shared context and returns what later stages use. |
| `src/config.mjs` | `DEFAULTS`, repo-overridable keys, the denylist and `.github/docs-sync.yml` parsing. |
| `src/allowlist.mjs` | Which paths are editable docs. |
| `src/git.mjs`, `src/range.mjs` | Git log and diff parsing, range selection, diff packing. |
| `src/narrative.mjs` | PR lookup and the change narrative fed to the models. |
| `src/carry.mjs` | Carrying rolling-branch edits forward and reviewer decisions. |
| `src/manifest.mjs`, `src/links.mjs` | The doc manifest and relative-link handling. |
| `src/plan.mjs` | Delete, create and link-fix planning after triage. |
| `src/triage.mjs`, `src/writer.mjs`, `src/checker.mjs` | Each model stage's prompt, input builder and output parser. |
| `src/gates.mjs`, `src/linediff.mjs` | The mechanical gates and the line diff they use. |
| `src/publish.mjs`, `src/pr-body.mjs` | Commit message, PR marker and PR body. |

Model calls, retries, pricing, GitHub access, globs, YAML and guideline loading come from
`core/`.
