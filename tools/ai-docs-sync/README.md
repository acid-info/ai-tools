# ai-docs-sync

Shared automation that keeps a repo's documentation in step with its code. On every push to a
repo's target branch it reads the code diff together with the commit messages and any linked
PRs, decides which docs are affected, rewrites them with one model, has a second model check the
rewrite, runs mechanical gates, and maintains a single rolling pull request with the result.
Humans merge it.

Consumers call this repo as a **reusable workflow** pinned to `@v1`. Upgrading the tool or
swapping a model is one edit here, not one per consumer.

> **Status: feature-complete, not yet tagged.** Every stage is implemented and unit-tested,
> and publishing has been run end to end against a sandbox repo from a local checkout. It has
> not yet run inside GitHub Actions. Do not add it to a repo until `v1` is tagged (see
> "Releasing").

## How it works

1. A push lands on the target branch: `develop` when the repo has one, otherwise the default
   branch, or whatever `target_branch` names.
2. The job checks out the **target branch** -- never a PR head -- for config, guideline files
   and docs, and checks out this repo for the tool.
3. The diff range runs from a cursor ref (`refs/ai-docs-sync/cursor`) to the checked-out head,
   so collapsed or queued runs never skip a commit and every commit is triaged exactly once.
4. A change narrative is built from local `git log`: each commit's title and body, plus the title
   and body of any PR those commits came from. Every model pass sees *why* the code changed, not
   just what.
5. Free exits first: a push that touches only docs (including merging the rolling PR) stops
   before any API call.
6. Triage picks the affected docs. A writer model rewrites each one, a checker model reviews
   the rewrite and can demand at most one correction pass.
7. Mechanical gates run on every edit: the path allowlist, resolution of added links, dash and
   attribution scans, size sanity, a banner for guideline-file edits, optional prettier.
8. The result is pushed to one rolling branch and one rolling PR per repo, updated in place.
   Edits not yet merged survive the next run. The cursor advances whatever the outcome.

Retries: every GitHub and model call has a timeout and is retried once, with backoff, on a
5xx, a 429 or Anthropic's 529. A second failure fails the run, and the cursor stays put so the
next push picks the range up again. The exceptions are the checker, whose failure leaves the
edits unchecked, and the writer: a failed call holds back only that doc, unless no writer call
succeeded and at least one failure was an outage (a 5xx, 429, 529 or network error) rather than
something about the request (a 400, a timeout).

The tool has **zero npm dependencies** and runs on Node 22's global `fetch`. Keep it that way:
no build step, no `package.json`.

## Adding it to a repo

Create `.github/workflows/docs-sync.yml` on your **default branch**:

```yaml
# AI docs sync. The tool lives in acid-info/ai-docs-sync -- edit it there.
# Runs on every push to the target branch and maintains one rolling docs PR.
name: AI Docs Sync

on:
  push:
    # List every branch that could be the target. The shared workflow resolves the real one at
    # run time and exits for the others, so over-listing is harmless.
    branches: [develop, main, master]
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      since:
        description: 'Commit SHA to diff from (backfill / re-run). Defaults to the cursor.'
        required: false
      dry_run:
        description: 'Print the would-be PR instead of pushing it'
        type: boolean
        default: false

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  statuses: write

jobs:
  sync:
    uses: acid-info/ai-docs-sync/.github/workflows/docs-sync.yml@v1
    with:
      # Optional. Forces the target branch. Omitted: `develop` if it exists, else the default
      # branch. Lives here rather than in .github/docs-sync.yml because the config file is read
      # from the target branch, so it cannot also choose it.
      target_branch: ''
      since: ${{ inputs.since }}
      dry_run: ${{ inputs.dry_run == true }}
    secrets:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
      OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
      # Optional. A fine-grained PAT from a shared bot account. Only needed when the default
      # branch requires status checks on every PR; see "Secrets".
      DOCS_SYNC_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DOCS_SYNC_TOKEN }}
```

`push` workflows run from the workflow file at the pushed commit, so the tool can be tested end
to end by temporarily listing a feature branch under `branches:`.

Pass the secrets explicitly. Do **not** use `secrets: inherit`: the tool has no business seeing
an `NPM_TOKEN` or a database URL.

`@v1` is a moving tag. A consumer that wants immutability pins the commit SHA instead; the
reusable workflow checks itself out at `job.workflow_sha` either way, and refuses to run if
that is empty.

### Secrets

| Secret | Required |
| --- | --- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Yes. The writer calls Claude Opus 5.5 |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Yes. Triage calls GPT-6 Luna; the checker calls GPT-6 Sol |
| `DOCS_SYNC_TOKEN` | No. Escape hatch, see below |

Triage runs at low effort. The writer and the checker run at medium.

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is supplied by Actions and is enough for the default path, with **one repo
setting**: a repo admin enables "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
(Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions). While it is off, creating a PR with
`GITHUB_TOKEN` fails with a 403 regardless of the `permissions:` block, and the tool fails fast
saying so.

A PR pushed with `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not trigger other workflows, so the rolling PR gets no CI
run. The PR is Markdown-only by construction and the tool reports its own gates as a
`docs-sync/gates` commit status.

Escape hatch, for a repo where that toggle is org-locked or the default branch requires a status
check on every PR: set `DOCS_SYNC_TOKEN` to a fine-grained PAT from a shared bot account with
`contents: write`, `pull-requests: write` and `statuses: write` on that repo only. The tool then
pushes and opens the PR as that account, which also triggers CI on the rolling branch.

## Per-repo configuration

At `.github/docs-sync.yml`, read from the **target branch**. `doc_paths` is the only required
key.

| Key | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `doc_paths` | Globs the tool may create or edit. Markdown only; anything else is refused in code. A list may be written as `- item` lines or inline as `[a, b]`. |
| `never_touch` | Subtracted from `doc_paths`. Everything under `.github/` is subtracted whether or not it is listed. |
| `extra_ignore` | Diff-side ignores, appended to the built-in list. Same semantics as ai-review. |
| `guidelines_files` | Priority list; the first that exists is loaded. `AGENTS.md` is special-cased as in ai-review. |
| `branch` | Rolling branch name. Default `docs/repo/sync`. Refused if it names the target or default branch. |
| `narrative_max_tokens` | Budget for commit and PR messages fed to the models. Default `6000`. |
| `label` | Label on the rolling PR. Default `docs-sync`. |
| `max_docs_per_run` | Writer calls per run; the rest are listed in the PR body. Default `8`. |
| `format_check` | `off` (default) or `strict`. `strict` needs `setup_command`. |
| `setup_command` | Shell run before prettier, e.g. `corepack enable && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. |

```yaml
doc_paths:
  - README.md
  - AGENTS.md
  - docs/**/*.md
  - apps/*/AGENTS.md
  - apps/*/README.md
  - apps/*/docs/**/*.md
  - packages/*/README.md

never_touch:
  - docs/superpowers/specs/**      # dated design records, not maintained docs

extra_ignore:
  - flake.lock
  - packages/types/src/payload.ts

guidelines_files:
  - AGENTS.md
  - CLAUDE.md
```

Models, effort, token budgets and severity thresholds are **owned centrally** in `DEFAULTS` in
`lib.mjs`. Setting one in a repo config logs a warning and is ignored: a repo that could pin its
own model would put the tool back in N places.

Built-in ignores cover lockfiles, `*.min.js`, `*.map`, `dist/`, `vendor/`, `__snapshots__/` and
`*.generated.*`.

Guideline files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, anything in `guidelines_files`) are editable like any
other doc when `doc_paths` covers them. An edit to one gets a banner at the top of the PR body
with the full diff inline. A repo that wants them hand-maintained lists them in `never_touch`.

## The rolling PR

- The rolling branch is always **the target head plus one commit** by `github-actions[bot]`
  holding every edit still open. That commit is built with git plumbing in a throwaway index,
  so the working tree never changes. It is pushed with `--force-with-lease` pinned to the
  branch state the tool inspected.
- **Carry-forward.** While a PR from the rolling branch into the target is open, its edits are
  carried into the next run. If the target has since changed one of those files, that edit is
  discarded and the file goes back to triage together with the earlier code changes the edit
  documented. Triage can select it again, in which case the edit is redone on top of the
  target's new version. Either way the PR is updated, so it never keeps a conflicting edit. After
  the PR is merged or closed nothing is carried: merged edits are already in the target, and
  closing means "not now". The next publishing run opens a fresh PR on the same branch.
- **Ownership.** The branch may hold, besides the tool's commits, merges (the PR's "Update
  branch" button) and other people's commits that only add or edit editable docs (a reviewer's
  suggestion); those edits are carried forward like the tool's own. Any other commit (code, a
  deleted or renamed doc), or a branch the tool never committed to, makes the run refuse before
  any paid call. Rename or delete that branch.
- The PR body lists, per file: the triage reason, the checker's verdict and issues, and whether
  a correction pass addressed them. It also lists carried edits, discarded edits and whether
  they were redone, held-back files and the gate that stopped them, new links and raw HTML,
  delete candidates, triage overflow, the commits and PRs in the range, and API cost. A
  guideline-file edit is bannered at the top with its full diff.
- Everything model- or narrative-derived in the body is defused: no live `@mentions`, no
  closing keywords, no raw HTML. The body is capped at 60,000 characters. A hidden
  `<!-- ai-docs-sync {...} -->` marker keeps the last 20 runs; it is informational only and
  never drives control flow.
- A `docs-sync/gates` commit status marks the branch head, because a PR pushed with
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` runs no CI.

## The cursor

`refs/ai-docs-sync/cursor` in the consumer repo points at the last target-branch commit the
tool finished with. Each run diffs `cursor..HEAD` and moves the cursor to `HEAD` whenever it
reaches a decision, whatever that decision is:

- a docs-only push (the loop guard);
- no code files left after ignores;
- a triage that finds nothing affected;
- nothing surviving the gates;
- a dry run;
- a published PR.

A run that fails leaves the cursor where it was. The ref never triggers `on: push`, and only
someone with `contents: write` can move it.

Read it or move it by hand:

```bash
git ls-remote origin refs/ai-docs-sync/cursor
git push -f origin <sha>:refs/ai-docs-sync/cursor
```

To re-process a range without touching the cursor first, dispatch the workflow with
`since=<sha>`. `since` must be an ancestor of the target head. Ranges are capped at the newest
250 commits on the target's first-parent line, so backfill a long history in slices.

## Changing a model

Edit `DEFAULTS` in `lib.mjs`, then check **two** other places in the same file:

1. **`PRICES`**: add the new model, or the cost line reports it as unpriced and excludes it from
   the total.
2. **`EFFORT_MODELS`**: a model-family regex gating Anthropic `output_config.effort`. A Claude
   model string that does not match silently loses the effort config rather than erroring.
   OpenAI calls send `reasoning.effort` whenever the stage has an effort set.

Then release it (below). Every consumer picks it up on its next run.

## Releasing

`v1` is a moving tag on `master`. After a change is merged:

```bash
git checkout master && git pull && git tag -f v1 && git push -f origin v1
```

Only the group that controls `ai-review`'s tags should be able to push this one (see "Security
model"). Consumers that want immutability pin a commit SHA instead.

## Running it locally

```bash
node --check docs-sync.mjs && node --check lib.mjs && node --test 'test/**/*.test.mjs'
```

That is what CI runs. `test/` imports `lib.mjs` only; `lib.mjs` has no side effects at import
time and never reads `process.env` or touches the network. `docs-sync.mjs` is the only file that
does.

To run the tool itself, `cd` into a full clone of the consumer repo checked out at its target
branch; the config is read from `.github/docs-sync.yml` there. Fetch first, so the
rolling branch's remote-tracking ref is current. In Actions the checkout does this. Then set
the env the workflow would:

```bash
git fetch origin && git checkout --detach origin/develop
```

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) REPO=owner/name TARGET_BRANCH=develop SINCE=<sha> \
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-junk OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-junk TRIAGE_ONLY=1 node /path/to/ai-docs-sync/docs-sync.mjs
```

> **Only `TRIAGE_ONLY=1` writes nothing.** Every other run writes to the real repo as soon as
> it reaches a decision. A `DRY_RUN=1`, or even a run that exits at the loop guard, moves the
> cursor ref. A plain run force-pushes the rolling branch and opens or updates the PR. Pushes

| Env | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `SINCE` | Start of the diff range; must be an ancestor of the target head. Skips the cursor read. |
| `TRIAGE_ONLY=1` | Stops after triage and never writes. With junk API keys everything free runs (range, changed files, narrative, packed diff, carry-forward, manifest, guidelines) and the run dies at a 401 having spent nothing. |
| `DRY_RUN=1` | Runs the model calls and gates (paid), prints the branch, the diffs, the PR title and body, and moves the cursor. Pushes no branch, touches no PR. |
| `DEBUG=1` | Logs every model's raw output and stack traces to stderr. |
| `PUSH_BEFORE`, `PUSH_FORCED` | What the workflow passes from the push event; used only when there is no cursor ref. |
| `RUN_URL` | Linked from the PR body, the commit message and the commit status. |

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is needed even for `TRIAGE_ONLY`: the cursor ref, the default branch, the open
rolling PR and the commit-to-PR lookups that build the change narrative are all API reads.

The reusable workflow itself has no runnable form without a caller: `workflow_call` cannot be
dispatched directly. End-to-end changes have to be proved on a real push in a consumer repo.

## Security model

- The job checks out the consumer's **target branch**, never a PR head. Config, guidelines, docs
  and the tool are trusted code. The diff, commit messages and PR bodies arrive as data and are
  only ever placed in user turns.
- The tool can only write `.md` files inside `doc_paths` minus `never_touch` minus a built-in
  denylist, checked on the canonicalised path (no `..`, no absolute, no symlink component) after
  every model call. A prompt-injected diff can, at worst, produce a bad doc edit in the rolling
  PR, which a human reviews.
- The tool may edit its own instruction source (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `guidelines_files`)
  when `doc_paths` covers it. Such an edit is bannered at the top of the PR body with its full
  diff, and the writer loads the target branch's copy of the guidelines, never a draft from the
  same run.
- The cursor is a git ref, movable only with `contents: write`. Nothing read from a PR body
  drives control flow; the rolling PR is located by head and base, not by marker.
- The force-push target is validated (not the target or default branch, safe charset) and the
  existing branch must hold nothing but the tool's commits, merges and doc additions or edits.
- No write credential is persisted in the checkout. The token and API keys are removed from the
  tool's environment at startup, so they are not passed to `setup_command`, prettier or git.
  Only the push and cursor-update child processes receive the token, via environment, and they
  run from a throwaway git dir that borrows the checkout's objects, so no hook or config written
  into `.git` runs next to the token. This does not sandbox `setup_command`: on a hosted runner
  its code runs as the same user as the tool, with passwordless sudo. A repo that does not trust
  its install scripts keeps `format_check: off`.
- `permissions:` is bounded by the consumer's workflow file. Never `secrets: inherit`.
- Nothing from the event payload is interpolated into shell text; the resolve step reads it from
  `env`.
- No network fetch of code at run time: the tool has no dependencies and `strict` formatting
  uses the consumer's own installed prettier.
- `@mentions` and issue-closing keywords in anything model- or narrative-derived are defused
  before posting.

**Whoever can push the `v1` tag executes code with `contents: write` in every consumer repo.**
This is a separate repo from `ai-review` for that reason: sharing a tag between a reader and a
writer would let whoever can push it turn a reviewer into a writer everywhere. Restrict tag
pushes here to the same group that controls `ai-review`; consumers that want more pin a SHA.
